a simple, trash OS i made out of my limited lua knowledge
at the start, you can press F to boot to shell instead of zpx os.
commands:
help: lists all commands
delete <filename>: deletes any file with that name. works in directories, too.
edit <filename>: edits any file with that name. works in directories, probably
